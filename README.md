A program that runs on an Arduino-based Morse-Code translator

Morse code is input by pressing or holding a momentary pushbutton, and sound is played from a buzzer.
The currently entered message is displayed on an LCD screen.
There is also a potentiometer to control the volume and a second pushbutton to play back the entered message.
